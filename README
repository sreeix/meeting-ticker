This is based on Toby Tripp's Initial application. Which exists here.

http://github.com/tobytripp/meeting-ticker

It tracks the amount of money spent on meetings, based on the time spent, number of attendees and Billing rate. It also tracks dollars spent over a period of a project. The idea is to start the app on a laptop and leave it in a meeting so that the dollars keep ticking and make it visible to people.

It uses Sqlite3, and it is simple to insall the appl

sudo ruby setup.rb

To start the application(Sinatra app)

ruby meeting-ticker.rb

That's it. Navigate to http://localhost:4567


That;s it. And stop the bleeding.


If you really want to use my sql then you will have to change the url's in the meeting.rb
